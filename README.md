# Wikidata user edits

A minimal client-side page that lists Wikidata items created or edited by given Wikimedia usernames. It is hosted at https://tiago.bio.br/wikidata_user_edits.

## Quick start

1. Open the page in your browser.
2. Enter one or more usernames (comma- or line-separated).
3. Choose whether to include created and/or edited items and adjust the max pages if needed.
4. Click **Fetch items** to load results and share the link if you want to re-run the same view.

The code is open source at https://github.com/lubianat/wikidata_user_edits.
